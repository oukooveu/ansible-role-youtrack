# YouTrack ansible role
[![Molecule](https://github.com/oukooveu/ansible-role-youtrack/actions/workflows/molecule.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/oukooveu/ansible-role-youtrack/actions/workflows/molecule.yml)

Role to install Jetbrains YouTrack project management platform.

## Important considerations

- YouTrack is installed from ZIP archive and only this option is supported.
- Don't forget to create backup before any upgrade.
- Please check [upgrade path](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/youtrack/server/Upgrade-YouTrack-ZIP.html#upgrade-matrix) before upgrading from one version to an another one.
- Seems like there is no way to fully automate upgrade (as it was with JAR version) and it's required to go through configuration wizard each time.
- During upgrade select previous release directory as a source (or restore from backup).
- Proper way to upgrade from JAR version is to create backup, stop service, (re)move `youtrack_home_dir`, install YouTrack from scratch and restore backup.

## Requirements

Zip or unzip should be installed on target host.

JDK is not required because of embedded into archive version is used.

  hosts: all
  vars:
    youtrack_logs_dir: "/var/log/youtrack"
  roles:
    - role: oukooveu.youtrack
```

### Molecule tests

To run tests locally:
```
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r molecule/default/requirements.txt
molecule test
```
If you just want to run YouTrack this can be done by changing last command to `molecule converge`. To cleanup test environment run `molecule destroy`.
